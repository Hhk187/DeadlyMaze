im making a 3d game in godot, it takes insperation from the movie "maze runner". i would like to make a mutiplayer game, it would be a mix of lethal company and the movie maze runner. so the player(s) would spawn in the center like the movie, and they would need to explore and find resources or items to defend themselfes at night because monster or spiders come to haunte them like the movie. ive got a concept about a merchant that would spawn in the maze at a random location and it would change location every 3nights. every 3nights the maze would shift shape and becomes harder for the player to exploit it resources, maybe even add a new element to it everytime the maze changes. im thinking about a gamplay m√©qanic where the player(s), when they die, they would spawn in the middle at daytime, with a concquance, i havent thought about it yet. everyday, in the morning, the four doors would open, like the movie, and close at night, if the player(s) get stuck outside the center area, they would be able to survive the night but it wouldnt be easy, i havent thought about the danger of it yet.

yes i need a lot of advices, im thinking about how the maze would be designed gamplay wise, there would be zones, very rawarding but dangers, that are attached by maze path. but idk, i need help
